###**Introduction**  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. We have data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).  
In this project, our goal is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. The outcome of the prediction is the "classe" variable having 5 factors- "A","B","C","D"&"E", that denote the quality of the excersice being performed.
